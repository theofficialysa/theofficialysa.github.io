        <h2>(Co-Founder/Co-Director/Chief Executive Officer)</h2>
        <p>     Hello, I'm Sumin Bae, a high school student based in Abu Dhabi. I'm honored to be a co-founder and director of the Youth Sustainability Alliance (YSA), a platform I'm deeply passionate about. My passion for environmental sustainability started when I was young. When I was 12 years old, I came across a documentary about pollution and the threat that it poses to society. Since then, I have begun reading more books and small articles about ways to mitigate pollution. My concern grew larger when my family faced severe medical conditions due to respiratory diseases caused by fine dust in South Korea. As I became more involved in initiatives related to environmental sustainability, I realized that the best way to make a difference is to start my own organization with my own ideas.

        <h2>(Co-Founder/Co-Director/Chief Executive Officer)</h2>
        <p>     Hello. My name is Marcus Ayoub and I’m a student at the American Community School of Abu Dhabi. As the founder of the YSA, I envision a world rebuilt. A healthy, vibrant, and sustainable world through the sophisticated projects we have planned for the YSA. As a child, a love grew in me for nature. I was exposed to the healthier, more luscious parts of the environment. Though, as I grew and gained perspective on the globe, I realized the world is nowhere near the sustainable health it could potentially reach. I felt as if I had a duty to this world, one which I aim to improve the state of the worlds health in numerous aspects. The best way I believed I could’ve done so, is gathering a group of people committed to improving the state of the world. The YSA.

        <h1>Roan Maguire-Shashoua</h1>
        <h2>(Founder of Berkeley Branch/Secondary Director)</h2>
        <p>     Hi, I’m Roan Maguire-Shashoua, and I founded YSA Berkeley, located at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, CA. Sustainability and environmental action have always been of utmost importance to me. Stopping climate change has a deadline the world cannot miss, and the steps needed to succeed in doing so are monumental. So without everyone getting involved, the healthy planet we all envision is not guaranteed. That’s why I believe in YSA; it empowers the youth–the demographic with the least amount of political and economic power–to make a meaningful impact on the issue that impacts us the most. Through measured action such as political engagement, and community education, we will make a difference on a global scale, and start a positive chain of youth engagement to drive change.

        <p>     Hello, I'm Adam Kablawi, and I'm the chief of technology in YSA. I believe deeply in living life and leaving an impact, for life is finite, but possibilities and opportunities are not. I have developed quite a valuable skillset in which I specialize in technology, hence, I believe in making the largest impact possible with what you excel at. By coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Swift, I aim to advocate and spread awareness about the cause of YSA through the world's most complex set of connections; the internet.

        <p>     Hello, I am Ryan Ayoub and I am a Junior at the American Community School Abu Dhabi. The world is ever-changing, and as individuals, we cannot do enough to combat global warming. As our Earth’s expiration date looms closer, I believe that it will take the masses to extend our time here in our loving home. While we need big changes we always need to start small, such as in our school community. Expanding to the rest of Abu Dhabi, the UAE, the Middle East, and the world, we should keep our goals in check and ensure that good things are to come.

        <h1>Jae Kim</h1>
        <h2>(Waste Management Officer)</h2>
        <p>     Hello, my name is Jae Kim and I am a senior in the class of 2024 at ACS. My passion for environmental sustainability stems from one of my other passions: computer science. As an avid coder and tech enthusiast, I am constantly exposed to the waves of new technology that entice consumers every year. While advancements in technology are exciting, they also come at the expense of the environment. 50 million tons of electronic waste are generated annually. In some parts of the world, that figure is expected to increase by 500%. As a part of YSA I hope to address this global issue by raising awareness in our community and globally; researching possible avenues to reduce electronic waste before it happens; and organizing tech drives to collect, recycle; and donate electronics.

        <p>     Hi, my name is Sun Kim and I am a sophomore at ACS. I’ve been deeply passionate about environmental sustainability ever since the start of high school and I am honored to be able to make a difference in our community, as well as hopefully globally within our YSA Club! As an officer in the YSA club, I believe that everything has a start. This is embodied in our club as I believe the start of promoting environmental sustainability starts from our ACS community and then can expand to the UAE, and hopefully even within the region! Environmental sustainability includes the idea of our planet facing numerous challenges, from climate change to biodiversity loss, and I believe that taking care of our environment is crucial for the well-being of future generations. By representing the YSA club, I hope to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share the same drive for creating positive change. Together, we can amplify our impact, raise awareness, and implement sustainable practices in our community.

        <h2>(Sustainability Lecturer/Consultant)</h2>
        <p>     Hello, my name is Ayaan Khan, and I am a junior here at the American Community School of Abu Dhabi, and I’m very excited to be an officer here at the Youth Sustainability Alliance, in order to make a positive impact for the betterment of not only the ACS community, but globally. My enthusiasm and interest in bettering the environment in which we live in, arised from my work last year as an executive member of the Pakistan Club that focused on environmental issues such as natural disasters by raising awareness and donations to aid the region. This experience opened my eyes to the rising ecological issues all around us, and led to me publishing articles for the ACS daily regarding this. Thus, in hopes to expand my work to a larger scale, I decided to work with the YSA organization, and aspire to strive for positive changes towards a more sustainable future.

        <h2>(Sustainability Lecturer/Consultant)</h2>
        <p>     Hello, I'm Abanoub. I think that most people grow up thinking they know about climate change and sustainability: It has become a staple in most schools’ education. However, I have realized that very few students truly feel empowered or able to create a difference in their communities. In fact, In large groups, the Herd mentality hinders the voice for climate change, since people often base their own actions on that what others do. That's why I decided to become a YSA officer. I've been deeply interested in encouraging fellow peers to make a difference since every change is a small step towards sustainability. I hope to share those ideas here on a broader scale and with more people than ever before.

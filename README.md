This is the code for the official Youth Sustainability Alliance website. The YSA is an international 501c3 non-profit organization founded by Marcus Ayoub and Sumin Bae, focused on developing a network of student-led environmental organizations across schools worldwide. Our goal is to accelerate sustainability initiatives and environmental awareness. We envision a future where the youth become agents for change on significant sustainability and environmental issues. 
As the Chief Technology Officer of the YSA, I believe deeply in living life and leaving an impact, for life is finite, but possibilities and opportunities are not. I have developed quite a valuable skillset in which I specialize in technology, hence, I believe in making the largest impact possible with what you excel at. By coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I aim to advocate and spread awareness about the cause of the YSA through the world's most complex set of connections; the internet.
